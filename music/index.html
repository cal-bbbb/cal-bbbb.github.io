                  Calum Boone, otherwise known as Cal B., is a
                  singer/songwriter, producer, and artist from Toronto, Canada.
                  At a young age, he moved to the US, living in various places
                  along the east coast where he would be exposed to various
                  types of music. Despite coming from a family with no musical
                  background, Cal B. was involved in music from a young age,
                  taking piano, violin, trumpet, and vocal lessons (albeit for a
                  very insignificant period of time) to help him get involved.
                  <br /><br />
                  By high school, Cal B. was experimenting with music production
                  in softwares like FL Studio and GarageBand, creating weird
                  little beats that sounded good at the time (obviously, they
                  were awful). By the time he was in university, he was hooked,
                  electing to spend more than a few of his nights creating beats instead of
                  sleeping. By 2020, he had released his first song, a feature
                  on a Yung Rama track. After countless hours watching YouTube
                  and learning the ways of audio engineering, Cal B. dropped his
                  debut single, Slow Down. Once the pandemic wrapped up, Cal B.
                  performed a few backyard and basement shows. It was there that
                  he would discover his passion for creating and performing.
                  <br /><br />
                  Now, Cal B. spends his time honing his engineering skills and,
                  when he finds some time, recording and releasing the
                  occasional record with his friends.
