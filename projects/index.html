                    Calum Boone, otherwise known as Cal B., is a
                    singer/songwriter, producer, and artist from Toronto, Canada.
                    At a young age, he moved to the US, living in various places
                    along the east coast where he would be exposed to various
                    types of music. Despite coming from a family with no musical
                    background, Cal B. was involved in music from a young age,
                    taking piano, violin, trumpet, and vocal lessons (albeit for a
                    very insignificant period of time) to help him get involved.
                    <br /><br />
                    By high school, Cal B. was experimenting with music production
                    in softwares like FL Studio and GarageBand, creating weird
                    little beats that sounded good at the time (obviously, they
                    were awful). By the time he was in university, he was hooked,
                    electing to spend most of his nights creating beats instead of
                    sleeping. By 2020, he had released his first song, a feature
                    on a Yung Rama track. After countless hours watching YouTube
                    and learning the ways of audio engineering, Cal B. dropped his
                    debut single, Slow Down. Once the pandemic wrapped up, Cal B.
                    performed a few backyard and basement shows. It was there that
                    he would discover his love for having a microphone in hand.
                    <br /><br />
                    Now, Cal B. spends his time honing his engineering skills and,
                    when he gets around to it, recording and releasing the
                    occasional record with his friends.

                  Hi
                  <p>
                    "I am an artist. I am an artist. I am an artist. Still
                    doesn't feel real. While I do tend to consider myself part
                    of many musical communities, I think one of the biggest that
                    I'm part of is from my current budding music career, through
                    which I've had the opportunity to make songs with many
                    different artists. Through my fraternity, we hosted concerts
                    at people's houses, collaborated on songs, and built a local
                    following of devoted fans to sing along whenever we play our
                    music. It's been something incredibly special to take part
                    in all this, and it definitely drives a feeling of
                    community, but also a sense of being part of something
                    larger than you-- something I don't often experience. I can
                    still remember how nervous I was for the first show,
                    especially how much I drank to overcome that, but getting on
                    that "stage" (it was just the floor) was absolutely
                    exhilarating. Going on a rollercoaster is thrilling, sure,
                    but it felt like nothing compared to this. The difference is
                    that when you're on a rollercoaster, you have a reasonable
                    expectation that you will end up where you started after
                    going around the track. It's safe. Performing, however, is
                    not. There's no safety net, no braking system to take over
                    if you embarrass yourself. And that's precisely what makes
                    it so powerful. Just 30 humans in a room with an amplifier,
                    building magic out of nothing." <br /><br />
