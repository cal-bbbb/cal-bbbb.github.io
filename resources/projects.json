The culmination of this project was a full campaign book to promote/pitch our work.<br /><br />As someone with ADHD/anxiety, I chose mental health due to my personal connection to the issue. I really enjoyed creating this campaign, using both 3d modelling software (Blender, Illustrator) and traditional editing tools like Photoshop for the 2d and 3d requirements. The screen element was made as a mock-up in Illustrator.",

The goal was to create a brand image that evoked a timeless, larger-than-life feel with the imagery.<br /><br />We were then asked to pivot our brand concept into a different business.
