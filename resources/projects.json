After many late nights of working and planning, we settled on a web app powered by Artificial Intelligence.</p><p>The front-end is powered by React, Bootstrap, D3.js, and some other libraries. We connected it to our Supabase and Flask AI back-end.</p><p>Users will (eventually) be able to view and manage their social media content, analyze their streaming data, and use the AI to interact with their data and guide them along their careers.</p><p>This is a live project and a work in progress, so feel free to follow along <a href='https://soundsteer.ai'>here</a> or down below.</p>",
